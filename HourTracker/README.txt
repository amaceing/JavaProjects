This is a little project Iâ€™ve been using at work. We currently still use time cards and have to add up our hours manually every two weeks.
This process can be tedious and mistake prone. I decided to write a program in both Java and Python (python program is in PythonProjects repo).
The program is currently console in/console out only. I will shortly be diving into make the Java version into a GUI program
and then the Python version.
